      <h2>Ambient:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Rotate items – incomplete boxes on the top and in the front to sell
          first.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place loose units on top or in front of full ones to prioritize
          selling them first.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid throwing loose units behind cases.</li>
        <li>Close gaps and pull cases forward as you go.</li>
        <li>
          When dealing with products that come in pairs, handle the second box
          if you've done the first one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Similarly, if someone has already handled the first box, avoid taking
          the second one to save time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay attention to the barcodes and product names on Tins, Jars, and
          some boxes. Ensure that the product name faces the customer when
          placing it on the shelf.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid overfilling. If the shelf is sufficiently stocked, place the
          excess product in the backstock.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Chill:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rotate items, including juices, cheese, and yoghurts.</li>
        <li>
          If the shelf has enough product and/or varying dates, backstock the
          new delivery to sell through.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Produce:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep ambient produce by aisle; fruit with tomatoes on one pallet, carrots, peppers etc on other</li>
        <li>Rotate salads with older ones on top of new ones.</li>
        <li>Collect loose units from underneath shelving.</li>
      </ul>
